Final Report: Artist Style Identification 

This project dives into the intersection of art and machine learning, which was something I briefly explored during my time in undergrad. Inspired by my senior seminar paper, I wanted to build a model that could analyze the unique styles of famous painters and predict who might have created an unknown painting. I thought this would also be interesting since I recently saw a couple of YouTube videos where people drew an artist’s painting in another painter's style. I wanted to see why specific attributes are attached to certain artists, like Van Gogh and his thick impasto brush techniques. So, I set out to build a system that could be trained to analyze unknown paintings and assign them to a certain artist. In the future, I’d like to turn this into an interactive tool where people can upload their own art, especially if they’re emulating someone’s style, and find out which artist’s techniques they’re closest to.

To get started, I needed a dataset with a wide variety of paintings. The one I used for my seminar paper wasn’t nearly enough, so I searched online and eventually found a Kaggle dataset with paintings from 50 artists. I focused on artists with at least 100 paintings to ensure better training accuracy. Working with this dataset presented several challenges, particularly due to the large size of the images. I had to preprocess the data extensively, which involved resizing the images to prevent crashes and shuffling them to create balanced training and testing datasets. This preprocessing step was critical to ensuring the model could handle the data efficiently and focus on learning stylistic details like brushstrokes and color choices.

I chose ResNet as my model because it’s great at extracting detailed features through its convolutional layers. While training the model, I visualized the layers to see how it broke down the paintings and identified key features. For the very same reason I chose to use PyTorch, instead of SciKit libraries since I was not doing color analysis related tasks which didn't need PCAs or dataframes. To evaluate its performance, I incorporated matrices to represent how accurately the model classified the paintings, providing an overview of its strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, I wrote a function called misplaced, which allowed me to pinpoint and visualize instances where the model misclassified an image. This function displayed the true label alongside the model’s prediction and the corresponding painting, helping me analyze specific cases where the model struggled. For example, when testing similar styles like Impressionist painters, the model sometimes confused the paintings, likely due to overlapping stylistic features. The error rate was around 0.3 to 0.4, depending on how the data was shuffled. While this was decent, I realized the model could perform better with more data and tweaks to the architecture.

This project showed how machine learning can help analyze and identify artistic styles. While I’m happy with the progress, there’s still a lot of room for improvement. I want to work on lowering the error rate by adding more data and exploring techniques like data augmentation. Eventually, I hope to build an application that artists and curators can use to study and categorize artwork. This has been a great start, and I’m excited to keep pushing it further.
