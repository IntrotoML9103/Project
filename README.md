# Project
Description: 
This machine learning project was inspired by my senior seminar paper in undergrad. I decided to explore the idea of utilizing a machine learning model to analyze the painting styles of famous painters. The model takes in paintings, learns the distinct features of each artist's style, and can then predict the painter of an unknown painting. In the future, I aim to expand this into a comprehensive model where users can input their own paintings—especially those created in an attempt to replicate another artist's style—and the model will accurately identify the artist they were emulating. 

# Milestone 1:
I would like to build something that is able to predict what kind of artist's style is being used when given a certain art piece. I want to do this since, I wrote a senior paper relevant to this topic a couple years ago. I wanted to used CNNs and AlexNet and ResNet systems to be able recognize the painting styles and having used some other algorithms I want to see how I can potentially do this with using PCAs and Classifiers. I think this might be too passionate of a project to achieve but I would like to atleast start trying to analyzing paint color schemes and try to associate them to an aritist. I think for the data sets, I would use the online databases with famous artists' paintings. I beleive it would be good to have both a training and a test dataset. So that I can compare to see how different artists can be identied just because the parameters are based on things that aren't really quantified. I would like to use CNNs if I can'e achieve this with what we have used so far or similar neural networks. I think this would be for artists and museum curators who might be trying to replicate or categorize paintings and understand how and why certain patterns are more prevelent in some paintings.

# Milestone 2:
To ensure I could actually pursue this project, I needed to find a database that would fit the requirements of my model. This meant finding hundreds of paintings by various artists, all compiled in one place. I scoured the internet for such a database since couldn’t use the one from my senior seminar paper since it didn’t contain nearly enough images. Eventually, I found a promising dataset on Kaggle: Collections of Paintings from 50 Artists(https://www.kaggle.com/code/paultimothymooney/collections-of-paintings-from-50-artists). After discussing with my professor, Thiago Hersan, we agreed to use only painters with over 100 paintings to ensure the model is accurately trained.

# Milestone 3: 
Now that I had enough data to start coding my project, I began working with my professor to understand the key elements I needed in my code and how to approach the project. Through weekly assignments and homework, I had developed a basic understanding of the model I would use RESNET and the convolutional layers required for feature extraction. However, I wasn’t entirely sure what additional steps were necessary to process such a large dataset. Since I wasn’t performing any color analysis, I didn’t need to work with PCAs. After a meeting with my professor, I was able to outline the pseudocode, which gave me a solid foundation to start coding the project.
 
# Milestone 4: 
This week I mostly focused on the dataprocessing to run my model and extract the features and then to verfiy how accurately my model runs and where it might be going wrong. I ran into a lot of problems with this as my dataset was extremely large. I had to make sure my images weren't so big that my program wouldn't run and the kernel kept crashing. Eventually with re-sized images my program started running well.
