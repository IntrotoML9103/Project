# Project
Description: 
This machine learning project was inspired by my senior seminar paper in undergrad. I decided to explore the idea of utilizing a machine learning model to analyze the painting styles of famous painters. The model takes in paintings, learns the distinct features of each artist's style, and can then predict the painter of an unknown painting. In the future, I aim to expand this into a comprehensive model where users can input their own paintings—especially those created in an attempt to replicate another artist's style—and the model will accurately identify the artist they were emulating.
