I would like to build something that is able to predict what kind of artist's style is being used when given a certain art piece. I want to do this since, I wrote a senior paper relevant to this topic a couple years ago. I wanted to used CNNs and AlexNet and ResNet systems to be able recognize the painting styles and having used some other algorithms I want to see how I can potentially do this with using PCAs and Classifiers. I think this might be too passionate of a project to achieve but I would like to atleast start trying to analyzing paint color schemes and try to associate them to an aritist. I think for the data sets, I would use the online databases with famous artists' paintings. I beleive it would be good to have both a training and a test dataset. So that I can compare to see how different artists can be identied just because the parameters are based on things that aren't really quantified. I would like to use CNNs if I can'e achieve this with what we have used so far or similar neural networks. I think this would be for artists and museum curators who might be trying to replicate or categorize paintings and understand how and why certain patterns are more prevelent in some paintings.
